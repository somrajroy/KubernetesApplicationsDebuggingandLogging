# Kubernetes Applications - Logging, Debugging & Troubleshooting.
The popularity of Kubernetes and its ecosystem grows like a snowball rolling down Mount Everest. However Kubernetes is a very complex ecosystem. This blog will help to effectively debug and analyze kubernetes pods (applications) to make things easy.<br/>
* Below are the official Kubernetes links which would aid in troubleshooting.

* Kubernetes is the de-facto standard for container orchestration. It provides the required abstraction for efficiently managing large-scale containerized      applications with declarative configurations, an easy deployment mechanism, and both scaling and self-healing capabilities. However it also introduces new challenges due to its ephemeral and dynamic nature. One of the main challenges is how to centralize Kubernetes logs. <br/>
* In Kubernetes, when pods are evicted, crashed, deleted, or scheduled on a different node, the logs from the containers are gone. The system cleans up after itself. Therefore DevOps engineers lose any information about why the issue/anomaly occurred. This transient nature of default logging in Kubernetes makes it crucial to implement a centralized log management solution. <br/>
